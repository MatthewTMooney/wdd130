        <p> Ireland is a small Island to the West of Europe. It shares a small sea with the UK,
            and only has a Boreder with Northern Ireland. Ireland was a very rural country up until the 70's,
            when the government made a large push thanks to a loan from the EU to modernise. It is now know
            as the Silicon Valley of Europe, with many large businesses, a Highly Educated Workforce, and tourism
            for is rich history and gorgeous rolling hills
